###### Assignment 1 outlays three classes that are used to translate english to a cryptographic language, Tutnese. Model.cpp handles the character translation, Translator.cpp instantiates a Model object, in order to handle the translation of words/sentences, FileProcessor.cpp outlays the writer and reader of the input/output files and handles accordingly. Main.cpp is the driver file for all the source files, using the command line to accept file name arguments.
