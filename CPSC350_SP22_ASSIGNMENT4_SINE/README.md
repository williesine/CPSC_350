###### Assignment 4: Fun With Stacks

###### SOURCE FILES
###### FileProcessor.cpp
###### SyntaxChecker.cpp
###### main.cpp

###### HEADER FILES
###### DoublyLinkedList.h
###### GenStack.h
###### FileProcessor.h
###### SyntaxChecker.h

#### SOURCES
###### Zybooks, GeeksForGeeks (help with doubly linked list destructor), C++ STL (help with template classes and implementation of them)

##### ERRORS
###### Everything compiles and executes, with some things off, I'm almost positive the logic of the classes/syntax checker is completely right, but issues came up with the implementation/execution. Full honesty, I need to get better at reaching out for help/assistance from Rene, I can tell this assignment is very close to being done, but ultimately came up short.
