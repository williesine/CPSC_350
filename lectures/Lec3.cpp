Tricks for Analyzing run-time

    CONSTANT - Just a few instructions, or a numerous instructions that only execute once, f)n) is usually O(1) or constant

    LOGARITHMIC - A problem that breaks n into smaller pieces at each step by a constant factor, f(n) is usually O(log n)

    LINEAR - A problem with a single loop iterating over n, then f(n) is often O(n)

    N LOG N (LINEARITHMIC) - A problem where the big problem is broken into smaller pieces at each step, solved separately, and then combined, then f(n) is often O(nLogn)

    QUADRATIC - double nested loops iterating over n (all pairs), then f(n) is usually O(N^2)

    CUBIC - Triple nested loops O(N^3)

    EXPONENTIAL - A brute force solution that tries every possible combination of data to find a solution, then f(n) is often exponential.

OTHER TYPES OF NOTATION

  Little O Notation - strict upper bound, rather than less than or equal to, little O is less than, still worst case, <

  Big Omega - lower bound (best case scenario/opposite of big o) >=

  Little Omega - Strict lower bound, >
