/*

MakeFile:
A file that simplifies compiling and cleaning up directory prior to adding and committing to github
use the command, "make all" to build an executable file
"realclean" command will find every executable in the directory, and removes it for submitting assignments to github
as programs get more complex, do not wait until the end to compile, COMPILE OFTEN

Arrays:
Array is a collection of data with two distinguishing characteristics:
  an array is ordered, meaning there is a starting and ending index
  Array is homogenous, every value must be of the same type

Array in c++ is not an object, just a contiguous block of memory

Declaring array:
  type name[size]; // int foo[10];

  Elements are not set to any particular, make a function/method that sets them to an initial value

++i is faster and more efficient than i++, DO SOME RESEARCH
`a pre increment updates the variable first than evaluates, post inc evaluates the variable than updates it`
